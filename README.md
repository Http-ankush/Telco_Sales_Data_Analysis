Customer Churn Analysis
1. Key Findings
1.1 Data Preparation & Cleaning
Missing values were identified and replaced appropriately (e.g., whitespace values were converted to 0).

TotalCharges column was converted from string to float for accurate numerical analysis.

Binary values (0,1) in the SeniorCitizen column were replaced with "Yes" and "No" for clarity.

Several categorical variables were analyzed to understand their impact on customer churn.

1.2 Churn Rate Analysis
The overall churn rate is 26.54%, meaning approximately 1 in 4 customers have left the service.

Senior citizens are more likely to churn than non-seniors.

42.1% of senior citizens have churned, compared to 23.6% of non-senior customers.

This suggests that older customers may need better engagement strategies to improve retention.

1.3 Customer Tenure & Churn Behavior
Customers with shorter tenures (1-6 months) show the highest churn rates:

60% of customers who have used the service for 1 month have churned.

45% of customers who stayed for 2-3 months have churned.

On the other hand, long-term customers are much more likely to stay:

Only 5% of customers who stayed for 5+ years have churned.

Insight: Customers tend to leave early in their subscription. A strong onboarding experience and early engagement strategies are crucial for retention.

1.4 Service Usage & Churn
Customers with no internet service or limited features tend to churn more frequently.

Churn rates for different services:

Online Security: Customers without online security churn at 34.5%, whereas those with online security churn at only 15.2%.

Tech Support: Customers without tech support churn at 31.3%, while those with tech support churn at only 14.8%.

Insight: Customers using value-added services (such as security and tech support) are more loyal. Upselling these services could improve retention.

1.5 Payment Method & Churn
Customers who use electronic check as a payment method have the highest churn rate (45.1%).

In contrast, churn rates are much lower for:

Credit card payments (15.2%)

Bank transfers (12.6%)

Insight: Customers using electronic checks may experience payment difficulties or inconvenience, leading to churn. Encouraging customers to switch to automatic payment options may reduce churn.

2. Conclusion & Recommendations
2.1 Address Early-Stage Churn
Since 60% of customers who leave do so within the first 3 months, customer onboarding programs should be improved.

Consider offering first-month discounts, personalized assistance, or educational resources to new users.

2.2 Retain Senior Citizens
With 42.1% of senior citizens churning, consider dedicated support teams, simplified service plans, and loyalty rewards for this group.

2.3 Promote Value-Added Services
Features like online security, tech support, and multiple service bundles significantly reduce churn.

Encouraging customers to opt-in for these services through targeted promotions can improve retention.

2.4 Optimize Payment Methods
Since 45.1% of electronic check users churn, incentivizing them to switch to credit card or bank transfers can lower churn.

Providing discounts for autopay enrollments or offering reminders for manual payments could be effective.

Final Thoughts:
This analysis highlights key customer behaviors leading to churn and provides data-driven recommendations to improve customer retention. Reducing churn by even 5-10% could significantly impact revenue growth. Implementing targeted retention strategies based on tenure, demographics, service usage, and payment preferences can lead to higher customer lifetime value (CLV) and improved business sustainability.
